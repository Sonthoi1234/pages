            <p>This page contains update logs for our Tower Defense Game "extension", whose main purposes include documenting bugfixes, new features/changes and more. Contains mostly major updates, but can also have beta versions packed in.<br>
            Bugs shown in some update logs will be fixed as soon as possible. If we don't fix it, just know that we might have included it as a intended feature, and if we did then don't request fixing it.<br>
            Some updates might not be here so if you want us to write it here, give us some information about what that update added (cause we don't have big enough brains to remember it all), and we'll try our best!<br>
            We do not receive requests for adding update logs for versions older than 1.6.0.</p>
