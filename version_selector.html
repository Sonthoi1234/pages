                    <li>A proper How To Play menu.</li>
                    <li>Fungi turret added.</li>

                Currently it has a lot of bugs, so I'll try my best to fix it soon.<br>
                A notable bug was with the upgrades, but I won't dive in too deep to the topic.</p>

                This version does not support turret selling and didn't have Forest maps, so it was kinda empty.</p>

                <p>The second beta for TDG 1.6.0 (the last being 1.6.3, but we won't talk about that now)<br>
                This version added options for switching between 30fps, 60fps and 120fps. Note that high framerates are unstable, so be aware!<br>
                Upgrades don't work for some reason, but you should be able to play it still.</p>

                 The update added Gear and Electric turrets, which are still in the game to this day.<br>
                 Gear turret was broken after 1.6.0 (where upgrades were added), but the bug was fixed after the latest 1.8.0 beta came out</p>

                Not much to say here, since it doesn't have a lot of features.<br>
                If you know that Wind turret is a meta right now then after playing this version, you might want to change your mind and stop becoming a noob.</p>
